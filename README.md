The Odin Project: Etch A Sketch project

**06/Aug/2022 Reflection**

Coming back after a 2 month gap (due to pure laziness). Added a reset button that toggles the page and a button that toggles dark mode. Thought about fleshing out the project further by making the cells smaller and adding a feature allowing for the user to input the grid values, but am deciding against this for now as I feel the need to move on or I will never finish the lessons. May revisit this in the future though.

Recalling my experience 2 months back, I was completely clueless on how to loop the cells/rows needed for this project, and ultimately, resorted to copying from stackoverflow. Once that part was done, assigning the background colour was a fairly simple task. I reviewed Wesbos's Drum Kit project referenced in an earlier lesson, using `console.log(e)` to list the available attritbutes in each cell, and then trial-and-errored my way into updating the backgroundColor whenver the mouse cursor hovered over each cell.
